# MR Reconstruction Code in Python

**2/7/2024:**  Pushed the first notebook. Contains working CG code. Composite and add opearators. Can do L2 regularized CG with real variables. Needs extention to complex variables.

**2/8/2024:**  Significant edits to code. Operators renamed. Added zero and real_fftn operator. Added CG utility functions and L2 regularization. CG working. Added 3 tests to the jupyter file. This is verion 0. Soon I will refactor to put the operators and CG in a module and out of this Jupyter file.
